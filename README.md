mrBogballe_M3W_FS2013
=====================
This is a rework of the Bogballe M3W Fertiliser spreader, originally made for Farming Simulator 2011. The original mod was downloaded from the FS-UK.com website and is available using the following link http://fs-uk.com/mods/view/12874

The mod has been converted to be fully compatible with the 2013 version of Farming Simulator, and to use the moreRealistic physics engine mod by Dural.

Features
========
The spread width is adjustable from 6m to 42m in 3m increments.<br />The spread rate is adjustable from 100L/Hectare to 600L/Hectare in 50L increments.<br />The capacity of the base unit is 1675L, each extension piece adds another 800L.


TODO/Planned
============
 1. ~~Add and remove weight depending on the fill level of the hopper.~~ - _Not required - the MR engine adjusts the weight automatically._
 2. Adjust implement weight depending on capacity configuration. - _Not being implemented just yet - the spreader seems heavy enough at the minute..._
